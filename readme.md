# This is the Add On Repository for the rtl_433_haos_addon Community Edition!


[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/catduckgnaf/rtl_433_haos_addon/)

To see the "main" page the project work, go here: https://github.com/catduckgnaf/rtl_433_ha




# Why?

I believe the community needs to own this script, to make modifications, and add things we want without the baggage of the existing rtl_433 codebase. For example the current add-on links directly to the 433 project, so when they make a breaking change there is no control, and the project is so large, nobody has put effort to improve the script. Many HA users want contact and door sensors, and are manually doing mqtt instead. I don't want weather sensors, I want door sensors!

## RTL_433 Add-On Community Edition

By Default all IDs are disabled in the config file. They have a description next to them, so you can simply remove the "-" for the ones you want


# Updates

Click the update button? Duh

The discovery script, and the latest rtl_433.conf are downloaded at run time. Currently the discovery script gets overwritten, and the rtl_433.conf does not.
So please periodically check for any updates on the rtl_433.conf.


## Pre-requesites and instructions:

1. an RTL Dongle
2. Home Assistant
3. Probably other things, but I'll update this later.
4. Profit
